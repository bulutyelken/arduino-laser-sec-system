# Laser Security System

Fix LDR, and laser to the opposite of the LDR

It send e-mail when laser cutted out(or we may say when something is passed over laser)


upload ledino.ino for the Arduino,
smtpino.ino for the ESP8266-01


Make sure you have grounded arduino's RST Pin

And ground ESP8266'S GPIO0 Pin for the Bootloader mode.

After you have upload the code, you can cancel these 2 connections
